## <h2>Research Assistant</h2>
<span style="font-size: 0.85em; margin-bottom: 10px; display: inline-block;">*Biosensing and Biorobotics Laboratory, University of Minnesota — Summer 2025–Present*</span>  
- I am developing a real-time computer vision and robotics pipeline for automated probe insertion in the mouse brain to monitor neural activity. My work integrates object detection with keypoint-based pose estimation and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) to recover the full 6-DoF probe pose, while employing CNN-based classification to assess probe bending and stability under challenging visual conditions.
