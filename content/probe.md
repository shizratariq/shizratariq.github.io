title: "Computer Assisted Neural Probe Insertion"
layout: project
permalink: /probe/
---

I developed a computer-vision–based system to detect neural probes, estimate insertion points using 3D calibration with ArUco markers, and guide automated probe placement. I also built the full workflow; from data labeling to trajectory planning, to enable accurate, safe, and repeatable probe insertions.
