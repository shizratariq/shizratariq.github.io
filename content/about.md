Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Robotics at the University of Minnesota, passionate about intelligent robotic systems and AI-driven solutions. My research focuses on robotic surgery for histotripsy, where I work with the UR5e robotic arm using ROS2 and MoveIt2 to improve motion planning and ensure collision-free navigation in constrained environments.

Beyond research, I have experience in machine learning, computer vision, and AI-driven prosthetics. I enjoy working on cutting-edge robotics applications that push the boundaries of automation and human-robot interaction.
