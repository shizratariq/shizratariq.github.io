Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Robotics at the University of Minnesota, passionate about developing robotic systems for healthcare. Currently, Iâ€™m working on Automated Probe Insertion in the [Biosensing and Biorobotics Laboratory](https://cse.umn.edu/me/biosensing-and-biorobotics-laboratory) under Professor Suhasa Kodandaramaiah. Previously, I worked on robotic surgery for histotripsy, where I used the UR5e robotic arm with ROS2 and MoveIt2 to improve motion planning and ensure collision-free navigation in constrained environments.

Beyond research, I love traveling and fashion. I enjoy meeting people and experiencing different cultures from around the world.

I love connecting with people, so feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜ƒ
