      <description>If you have rough ideas on how goroutines work but never took the time to learn the idiomatic approach and why we want to run goroutines certain way, this blog will be of help. In this post, I will be summarizing what I have learned from Chapter 8: Goroutines and Channels of the Go Programming Language book as well as The Go Blog on Go Concurrency Patterns.
This blog post will be helpful if you are not familiar with any of the below:</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a Master‚Äôs student in Robotics at the University of Minnesota, passionate about intelligent robotic systems and AI-driven solutions. My research focuses on robotic surgery for histotripsy, where I work with the UR5e robotic arm using ROS2 and MoveIt2 to improve motion planning and ensure collision-free navigation in constrained environments.
Beyond research, I have experience in machine learning, computer vision, and AI-driven prosthetics. I enjoy working on cutting-edge robotics applications that push the boundaries of automation and human-robot interaction.</description>

      <description>Turtlebot3 RRT Pathfinder üîó Developed and implemented the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for autonomous maze navigation in Gazebo simulations. Optimized motor command accuracy to enhance path-following precision. Addressed Lidar inconsistencies by refining sensor data processing for improved obstacle detection. Achieved a 40% success rate in maze traversal under simulated conditions. Recorded a fastest traversal time of 1 minute and 42 seconds. Improved overall navigation efficiency through iterative testing and parameter tuning.</description>
